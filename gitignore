cache/*
tmp/*

## Exclude any IDE folders (if you work collaboratively this is invaluable)
/.idea/*
/.project/*

#### END Folder exclusions

#### START File exclusions

/configuration.php

## Ignore some files ALWAYS

*.md
# image database files

#### END File exclusions

#### START Custom includes

## Include a component
## Follow the example below and edit appropriately
## The logic is straight forward (once you know it), and can be 
## applied to any folders within the file system
# Frontend (easy)
#!/components/com_mycomponentname/

## Administration (not easy)
#!/administrator/
#/administrator/components/*
#!/administrator/components/
#!/administrator/components/com_mycomponentname/

### END Custom includes
